\section{Instruction Interpreter}
The function \code{interpInst} is very central to the program, as it parses
out the current instruction of the program by way of pattern-matching. For
each case we handle whatever errors can be handled at that level (further
error-checking occurs within the corresponding monadic functions of the
instruction to be executed). If no errors are found we perform the operation
and return whether or not we wish to proceed with the program (ie. special
cases like \code{HALT}, as shown below, does not continue). For instructions that need it the
program counter is incremented.
