\section{Tests}

We did not have time to make some strictly structured tests but ran of a lot of
ad-hoc instructions lists when debugging.

Our MSM can sucesfully execute the \texttt{p42} program and will only have $42$
left on the stack. Note that this is the expected behaviour since our
\texttt{HALT} will not pop the last element and return it. During testing we
found it more helpfull that it dumped the entire state of the MSM.

We also included the QuickCheck code from the assignment text and created a
single test of the addition operator.

\codefig{tests}{../MSM.hs}{295}{336}{Our quickly scribbled test cases.}

As seen in Figure \ref{code:tests} we also constructed a small amount of tests
which represent our test patterns. As written we did a lot of tests during
debugging we have not written down.
