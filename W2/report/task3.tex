\section{Error types}
Although we have followed the templated error types, as specified in the
assignment text, we found it hard to make use of the \code{Error} type, as the
monad type class would not allow us to give \code{fail} and \code{Error} as
its argument, which we thought were the best way to use it.

To circumvent this issue we made a function that took an \code{ErrorType} (the
declaration of which is shown below) and generated an appropriate string to
pass on to \code{fail}.
\codefig{error-types}{../MSM.hs}{50}{55}{Declarations of \code{ErrorType}}

This \code{ErrorType}-to-\code{String} is simply done by pattern-matching
each case and returning a corresponding string. The code for this is given
below.

function}
