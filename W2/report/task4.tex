\subsection{The MSM Monad}
The bind operator of the \code{MSM} takes an \code{MSM a} and based on the
evaluation of applying a state \code{x} to its contents \code{a} we either
get an \code{Error} (which didn't get used properly) or a valid \code{State}.
In the case of a valid \code{State} we apply the monadic function \code{f} to
the result of the previous computation \code{r} producing the following
\code{State}, as shown below, otherwise we propagate the \code{Error}.

\subsection{The MSM Functor}
From following some documentation, we arrived at a pretty generic functor
instance, as can be seen below.

\subsection{The MSM Applicative}
We're not entirely sure what it actually does, but were told to remove the
warning before handing in the assignment, so we puzzled this together in much
the same manner as with the functor.
