\section{Running the MSM}
The \code{runMSM} code was pretty much taken right out of the skeleton, with
some slight adjustments.

\codefig{runMSM}{../MSM.hs}{291}{293}{Excerpt showing the \code{runMSM}}
Our \code{MSM} had its tuple data in reverse, if the
\code{runMSM} is supposed to give back the state of the program as it halted.
Therefore we had to change the \code{snd} part into \code{fst}.
