\section{Type for modelling MSM program}

The type we declared for modelling the instructions are taken largely fomr the
supplied material. Placeholders for \texttt{READ} and \texttt{WRITE} have been
added. Our implementation looks like this Figure \ref{code:insttypes}

The program is \texttt{[Inst]}, since this nicely represents a sequence of
instructions to be executed.
