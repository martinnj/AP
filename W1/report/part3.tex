\section{Test with Hilbert Curves (changed for resubmission)}
%We failed in producing a correct Hilbert curve. We did however see parts of it
%drawn to some extent, but failed to find the source of the problem. We do know
%for a fact that the conversion to screen coordinate system is flawed, but some
%of the issues may also stem from our manipulatory library functions.

For the resubmission we have fixed the \texttt{toSVG} function so it now looks
like Figure \ref{code:tosvg} and produces the following pictures without
problems.
